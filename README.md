# 👕 What to Wear — React Weather-Based Clothing App

## 📖 Project Description

**What to Wear** is a responsive React application that helps users browse clothing items based on current weather conditions.  
Users can preview clothing items, view detailed images in a modal, and add new garments through a form-driven interface.

The project focuses on **component-based architecture**, **state management**, and **API-ready UI patterns**, simulating how modern front-end applications are built and scaled.
